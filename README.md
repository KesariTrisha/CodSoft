Task-1:"Caluculator"
 
  I have successfully completed my first task which is to perform a caluculations on Arthimetic operations.Using "Python Programming" which is offered by @CodSoft.
  I have done my task using whileloop.First we have to take three inputs from the user a,b,c.a indicate to enter a any number and b  also indicates t enter a any number and c indicates
  to enter a arthimetic operation.After that if c=(+ or - or * or /) it can perform that operation whatever we enter a operation.Then print the result,we can get an output.

Task-2:"Rock Paper and Scissor Game"
   
    I have completed my second task on Rock paper and Scissor game.The game between user and computer.User has to enters the rock or paper or scissor.But computer will generate randomly 
    itself.Initially they score is 0.After we can check conditions if user will wins user will get score+1 or else computer  will wins computer get a score+1.After that we have to check 
    whose score is greater.If computer score is greater than user, computer will wins or else if user score is greater than computer then user will wins or else both scores are same then 
    return the game is tie.

Task-3:"Password Generator"
     
     I have completed my third task to generate a password.First we have to take a lists to store a Specialsymbols,Uppercase,Lowercase,Numbers.Then we have to ask questions to the user how 
     many numbers do you want and how many specialsymbols do you want and how many letters do you want?.The password must be contain atleast 12 characters.Then we have to check all 
     conditions if it is true then the output is final_password.

This Internship is veryuseful for us which was provided by @CodSoft.These tasks are real life  examples.In this Internship I have learned many things using python programming.
